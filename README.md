# NYU Maze
### Maze Build reflection
I had major issues when creating this project. First, using the videos that were a few years old used the
Unity 2019 version which was hard to match up current packages. However, once I moved to Unity 2021 and added the locomotion 
system, everything worked somewhat well. By, I would like to re-iterate this assingment was difficult in the time that was alloted and  would have been better to break this up over two weeks. Additionaly, the lectures should be made current, or at least there whould be a readme with each lecture that show what changes should be made to get the packages to work with the instructions. Anyway, here is the video and some of the screenshots related to the project.
